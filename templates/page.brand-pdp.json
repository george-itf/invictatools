For porcelain tiles, wet cutting is essential. For concrete and masonry, both methods work but wet cutting gives better results and longer blade life.</p>"

It's determined by the blade diameter and the RPM of your tool. Never exceed the MPS rating — it's printed on every PDP blade. EN 13236 requires all diamond blades to display this rating.</p>"

For <strong>reinforced concrete</strong> (concrete with steel rebar), use a blade specifically rated for reinforced concrete. For cutting metal pipes or steel, use an <strong>abrasive cutting disc</strong> instead.</p>"
